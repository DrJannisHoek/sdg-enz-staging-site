The Berlin district of Treptow-Köpenick has long been concerned with sustainable development at the municipal level. As early as 2004, the "Local Agenda 21 Treptow-Köpenick" was adopted, which included a mission statement and a procedure for implementing sustainable development in the district of Treptow-Köpenick. 
From 2018 to 2020, this mission statement was revised, aligning it with the United Nations' Agenda 2030 and its 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). <br>

All of this took place in a practice-oriented and participatory process with various actors in the district, who were able to network and develop concrete measures in a total of 8 workshops. The first workshop was already held in September 2018, while the last one unfortunately had to be postponed until September 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Each workshop followed a similar pattern: after a presentation by topic mentors, general ideas for achieving the respective SDG were first collected from all participants. This collection of ideas was then taken up in small groups and translated into concrete measures. <br>

The result is a municipal sustainability strategy that was adopted in 2021 and, in addition to the concrete measures, also includes an indicator-based monitoring. 
This monitoring is published here, in a web-based format. <br>

The monitoring system consists of two areas: The "measure indicators" are intended to make the results and effects of the adopted measures visible, while the "SDG indicators" represent more comprehensive data for the achievement of the Agenda 2030 goals at the district level. 
The "measure indicators" were derived directly from the adopted measures. Here you can also find a lot of data which was provided by different actors of the district. Without these data collaborations, it would be difficult to map the adopted measures. 
The selection of the more general, district-wide SDG indicators, on the other hand, was based primarily on common sustainability indicators (widely used in the literature), which were then placed in the context of Treptow-Köpenick's sustainability strategy. Official data is primarily used here. <br>

The website itself is based on the Open-SDG platform and was further developed in cooperation with students of the HTW Berlin. Many thanks therefore go to: Marlene Bueltemann, Grace Dodi, Lucia Feddersen, Christina Gottschalk, Neslihan Kilic, Mia Lohe, Mahulome Pede and Hatice Pinar. <br>

Prof. Florian Koch, Sarah Beyer and Chih-Yu Chen from HTW Berlin were involved in the scientific support of the project. <br>

The person responsible for the Treptow-Köpenick district office is Dennis Lumme, the municipal development policy officer. <br>

Harald Oehlerking was responsible for the design of the sustainability strategy. <br>

The entire project was funded by the "Servicestelle Kommunen in der Einen Welt" as part of the INDIKON and DATAKON projects.
